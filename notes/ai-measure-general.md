Based on my search of academic literature, I need to be transparent about a significant finding: **there is remarkably little peer-reviewed academic research specifically analyzing post-election implementation of individual ballot measures**. The scholarly literature has a major blind spot in precisely the area your app would address.

## What Academic Literature Actually Covers

**Comparative State Analysis (Not Post-Election Tracking)**

The available academic research focuses on **whether states with ballot initiative processes have different policy outcomes than states without them**—not what happens to specific measures after they pass [^1][^2].

Key studies use:
- **Synthetic case control methods** to compare outcomes over time between initiative and non-initiative states [^1]
- **Counterfactual models of inference** to estimate what policy outcomes would have been without the initiative process [^1]

This research asks: "Do initiative states have different abortion laws/tax policies/environmental regulations?" rather than "Did Proposition X get implemented as written?"

**The Confounding Problem**

Academic studies note that states with ballot initiatives are **distributed non-randomly**—they tend to be western, more populist, with specific political cultures [^2]. This makes isolating the effect of any single measure difficult because you can't easily separate the measure's impact from the state's underlying characteristics.

## The Evidence Desert: Post-Election Analysis

**Limited Peer-Reviewed Research on Implementation**

The search reveals that analysis of **legislative undermining, judicial blocking, and administrative dismantling** appears primarily in:
- Policy center reports (Brennan Center for Justice) [^4][^9]
- Investigative journalism (ProPublica, Ohio Capital Journal) [^5][^8]
- Opinion pieces citing political science research generally [^6][^7]

These are valuable but **not peer-reviewed academic literature** on post-election measure trajectories.

**General Policy Evaluation Literature**

While comprehensive reviews of policy evaluation methods exist [^3], they are **not specific to ballot measures**. The academic field treats voter initiatives as inputs to the policy process rather than tracking their distinct implementation trajectories.

## Why This Gap Exists

Academic political science appears to treat ballot measures as **"black boxes"**—studying what goes in (voting behavior, campaign spending, voter knowledge) and comparing broad outputs (state policy differences), but ignoring the **implementation mechanics** between passage and outcome.

This creates an opportunity for your app to generate original data in an understudied space. The lack of systematic academic tracking of:
- Judicial injunction rates by measure type
- Legislative amendment timelines  
- Administrative rulemaking delays
- Budget appropriation gaps

...means there is no established baseline against which to compare new measures' implementation likelihood.

## Methodological Implications for Your App

Given this literature gap, your app could potentially contribute to academic research by generating the **longitudinal dataset** that doesn't currently exist. The synthetic case control methods used in comparative state research [^1] could theoretically be applied to your implementation data—comparing measures that faced judicial blocking versus those that didn't, or measuring time-to-implementation across different policy domains.

**Key takeaway:** The academic literature validates that implementation tracking is an **unstudied dimension** of direct democracy. While scholars debate whether the initiative process produces different policy outcomes at the state level, no one is systematically tracking whether individual measures survive the post-election institutional gauntlet of courts, legislatures, and bureaucracies.
